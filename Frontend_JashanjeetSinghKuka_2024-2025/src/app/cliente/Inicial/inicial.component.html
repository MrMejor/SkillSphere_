          I have developed a web application designed to enhance online studying by providing a platform that benefits both teachers and students. This innovative application offers employment opportunities for teachers, allowing them to post study materials such as PDFs, photos, and text, similar to the interface of LinkedIn. Students can easily access these resources, engage with the content by liking and commenting, and foster a dynamic learning environment. The platform aims to create an interactive educational community where knowledge sharing is seamless and accessible.
